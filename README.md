AI-powered Nutrition Analyzer for Fitness Enthusiasts

Nutritional analysis is the process of determining the nutritional content of food. It is a vital part of analytical chemistry that provides information about chemical composition, processing, quality control and contamination of food. People explore nutrition trends, are aware of their daily eating habits, and keep up a healthy diet. Finding out a foodâ€™s nutritional value is done through nutritional analysis.
        Artificial Intelligence in nutrition is becoming popular for prevention and treatment. AI to provide a real-time update about nutrition intake. The main aim of the project is to building a model which is used for classifying the fruit depends on the different characteristics like colour, shape, texture etc. Here the user can capture the images of different fruits and then the image will be sent the trained model. The model analyses the image and detect the nutrition based on the fruits like (Sugar, Fibre, Protein, Calories, etc.). Utilized a customized Fruit image dataset and applied CNN for the identification of 5 fruits classes. After fruit recognition, image segmentation and calorie detection module fetch the calories and other nutrition values of detected fruits and display it to the user.
